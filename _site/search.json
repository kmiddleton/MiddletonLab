I am part of a large group of faculty and graduate trainees who teach first year clinically oriented human anatomy to first-year medical students. In the past I have taught our undergraduate pre-health Human Anatomy lecture and lab courses. I was involved in transitioning these large human anatomy lecture and lab courses to a “flipped classroom” format with clinical context."

Dr. Elizabeth King (MU Biological Sciences) and I co-developed a graduate course in quantitative methods for life sciences students.
