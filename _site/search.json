We are seeking to estimate these quantities for a wide range of traits in two- and three-dimensional imaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are part of a large collaborative project led by Richard Sherwood (University of Missouri), which also includes Dana Duren (University of Missouri), Kieran McNulty (University of Minnesota), Heesoo Oh (University of the Pacific), and Manish Valiathan (Case Western Reserve University). The overall goal is to understand the patterns of human craniofacial growth and variation.\nWe work with a very large set of longitudinal cephalographs that make up the AAOF Craniofacial Growth Legacy Collection. These have been landmarked for dozens of anatomical features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use information about current and past morphology, estimates of skeletal maturity, and standard facial types to predict future growth.\n\nWe use Bayesian inference to fit a double logistic growth equation to each trait\n\\[\ntrait(age) = \\frac{a_1}{1 + \\exp(-b_1 (age - c_1))} +\n             \\frac{a_2}{1 + \\exp(-b_2 (age - c_2))}\n\\]\nwhich includes two periods of growth, prepubertal and a pubertal growth spurt. This approach works better than more commonly used (and easier to fit) polynomial or spline models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are developing Shiny apps to bring the results of these analyses to the clinical community.\nHere are some recent papers from this project:\n\n\nHardin, Anna M, Ryan P Knigge, Hee Soo Oh, Manish Valiathan, Dana L Duren, Kieran P McNulty, Kevin M Middleton, and Richard J Sherwood. 2022. “Estimating Craniofacial Growth Cessation: Comparison of Asymptote- and Rate-Based Methods.” Cleft Palate Craniofac.

    "text": "We have a long-term collaborative project with Dr. Theodore Garland, Jr. in the Department of Biology at the University of California, Riverside, studying the effects of exercise and artificial selection on skeletal morphology and bone mechanics in house mice.\nThe Garland Lab has been artificially selecting mice for high levels of voluntary wheel running for more than 60 generations. These “high-runner” mice can run more than 25 km in one night, which is taxing to most physiological systems. In the lab, we are particularly interested in the effects (both separate and combined) of exercise and artificial selection on skeletal form, growth, physiology, and function.\n\nInbred High Activity Mini-Muscle Mice\nA major project in the lab is the establishment of an inbred strain of high-activity mice that exhibit the mini-muscle phenotype. This project was begun in 2007. As of Fall 2014, we are over 20 generations into inbreeding and can now officially say that the strain is inbred.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: When standardized to body mass, mice with the mini-muscle phenotype (left) have significantly longer and thinner femora than randomly bred controls (right).\n\n\nThe strain of mice that results from the project, which will both exhibit the mini-muscle allele and have genes enabling them to run great distances are a potential model organism for human musculoskeletal diseases and disorders. For example, mice can be crossed with other strains of mice known to have high or low bone mass to dissect the complex interaction between muscle function and normal bone growth.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of mini-muscle (left) and wild-type (right) phenotype triceps surae muscle. The mini-muscle is about 50% less massive. (Photo courtesy of Mark Chappell)\n\n\nFuture experiments may include physiological measurements such as maximal oxygen consumption during strenuous exercise. High-runner mice generally have higher oxygen consumption, but this varies depending of the presence of the mini-muscle allele. Additionally, inbreeding may affect the physiological capacity of mice, so comparisons between the mice described in this experiment and “regular” high-runner mice will provide insights into the complex regulation of physiology. Research in the lab also concerns differences in bone shape and materials between mini-muscle mice and both high-runner mice and “standard” strains of lab mice.\nComparisons of shape and breaking strength with other types of mice will help us understand how genetics control the formation and, ultimately, function of the skeleton. In humans, for instance, it has been shown that certain bone shapes are more prone to fracture, and that these shape differences are genetically determined. By studying the same relationship in a model organism, in which we can have much greater experimental control, we will be able to better understand human biology."

    "text": "In collaboration with Casey Holliday (University of Missouri), we are studying the evolution of cranial kinesis across the non-avian theropod dinosaur to bird transition.\nCranial kinesis (movement among the bones of the skull, excepting the jaw) required a significant reorganization of skeletal tissues and was likely a major evolutionary factor in the highly diverse feeding apparatus and ultimately the diversification of modern birds. The goal of this project is to understand the biomechanical environment of the feeding system.\n\nComputational modelling of cranial function has allowed us to estimate all the forces acting on the jaws and skull. From a CT-scan, we generate a 3D model, convert to a finite element model and then “map” muscle attachments.\n\nWe use these muscle attachments combined with knowledge of muscle contractile properties to generate a 3D picture of the biomechanical environment of the head."

This used to be done with ink, but now it is automated. We aimed to bring 3d analysis of kinematics to small animals. Moreover, we wanted to use easily obtainable hardware.\nWe set up a pair of GoPro cameras at about 60° to one another and filmed mice walking freely down a walkway.\n\nWe used DeepLabCut trained on about 450 frames that were manually digitized. Following this, we auto-labeled ~40,000 frames (~480,000 points) from 148 locomotor trials. Movies were digitized separately and then calibrated to one another to give 3d coordinates.\n\nWe track points that define limb position and allow us quantify locomotor parameters (stride length, stance width, duty factor, etc.).\n\nWe end up with a full three-dimensional representation of the stride cycle.\n\nWe can then statistically compare kinematic variables. We have only manually digitized 1% of the frames, saving time (and tedious, error-prone digitizing)."

This is an excellent textbook (now in its second edition, still remarkably inexpensive) for teaching advanced undergraduate and introductory graduate statistics. The new edition of this book has associated R code, mostly making this package redundant. But I still like having the datasets from the book handy. I use them for teaching and demos really often, like the distribution of counts of desert birds or hemoglobin levels in different populations.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(abd)\nggplot(DesertBirds, aes(count)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"darkred\") +\n  labs(x = \"Count\", y = \"Number of Species\") +\n  cowplot::theme_cowplot()\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(abd)\nggplot(Hemoglobin, aes(x = hemoglobin, y = relative.frequency)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"darkred\") +\n  labs(x = \"Hemoglobin\", y = \"Relative Frequency\") +\n  facet_grid(group ~ .) +\n  cowplot::theme_cowplot()\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\nThe package can be installed via CRAN\n\ninstall.packages(\"abd\")\n\nor directly from GitHub:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"Middleton-Lab/abd\")\n\nWe have had a lot of dependency creep over the years, so the number of packages that get installed alongside abd can be quite large."
