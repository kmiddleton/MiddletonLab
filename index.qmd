title: "Evolutionary Functional Morphology (among other things)"
---

Our lab is in the [Division of Biological Sciences](https://biology.missouri.edu/) at the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu/).

Our research focuses on vertebrate musculoskeletal physiology, form, and function in the contexts of animal locomotion and evolution. We integrate studies across multiple scales from micro-scale structural materials of bone to macro-scale whole bone morphology to evolutionary changes across vertebrate taxa and with comparisons to extinct organisms.

Here are a range of projects that we have worked on, many of which are ongoing. Click the image to jump to the research page:
