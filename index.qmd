Our lab is in the Division of Biological Sciences at the University of Missouri.

Our research focuses on vertebrate musculoskeletal physiology, form, and function in the contexts of animal locomotion and evolution. We integrate studies across multiple scales from micro-scale structural materials of bone to macro-scale whole bone morphology to evolutionary changes across vertebrate taxa and with comparisons to extinct organisms.
