I am an Associate Professor in the [MU Division of Biological Sciences](https://biology.missouri.edu/). My interests include Bayesian inference, Functional morphology, Biomechanics, and Statistical teaching. I'm an active member of the informal  [DataPhiles](https://elizabethking.org/dataphiles/) discussion group.

Previously I was a faculty member in the [Department of Pathology and Anatomical Sciences in the University of Missouri School of Medicine](https://medicine.missouri.edu/departments/pathology-and-anatomical-sciences). From 2007-2012, I was in the [Department of Biology at California State University, San Bernardino](http://biology.csusb.edu/). Prior to that I was a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University and the University of California, Riverside. In deep time, I was an undergraduate at Wake Forest University and then a doctoral student in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Brown University](http://www.brown.edu/academics/ecology-and-evolutionary-biology/). 

If you want to read about bird foot evolution, here's a link to my dissertation: [Morphology, evolution, and function of the avian hallux](http://www.worldcat.org/title/morphology-evolution-and-function-of-the-avian-hallux/oclc/54004056).

I firmly believe in (a modified version of) [Federico Ardila's](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/) [basic axioms](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf):

> Axiom 1. Quantitative biology potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

> Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering quantitative biology experiences.

> Axiom 3. Quantitative biology is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

> Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
